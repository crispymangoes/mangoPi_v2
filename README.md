# mangoPi_v2

The mangoPi is a FPGA development board designed to be for beginners. This repo combined with my youtube channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeLSZnDQhn2w7gunQxIRu9Q/videos
will allow you to understand the inner workings of this FPGA development board, as well as how to use it.Please note that this project is still very much in development, so the PCB design, and schematic have issues that will be fixed with the version 3 of this board. I'll be uploading my progress to my YouTube channel, so check it out if you are interested.

## The Story
Hi I'm Ryan aka Crispy. I am a self taught electronic enthusiast, with a degreee in Mechanical Engineering from Colorado School of Mines.Two years ago I started my search for a FPGA development board for beginners. While I found a ton of boards, I also found two big issues with them. The boards either lacked the peripherals and features that I needed, or they simply did not have enough documentation or tutorials in order for me to understand HOW to use my board.I searched for a year and tried a few FPGA development boards along the way, until I finally decided to make my own.
